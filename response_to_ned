>> To be honest, I haven't seen any data analytics websites work out very well. 

Please take a look at what I have so far and let me walk you through the user
flow and then reconsider.

>> Since they focus more on math than CS, they can be really distracting.

During my presentation to the Employer's, I'll try to make the computation
examples as concrete as possible such that someone with no background in math and statistics can still appreciate.  For example, in the one-way ANOVA, I'll explain it using a concrete example (ie. your a medical research trying to study the efficacy of
several treatments).   


>> Plus, I think it's really hard to create a usable interface to allow users to interact with data.
